<h2>About</h2>
<p>This is a pretty simple repo that I'm using for my coursework on Udacity's Nanodegree program</p>

<h2>File Structure</h2>
<p>This is relatively straight forward, all that is currently in this repo is:
<ol><li>raw CSVs of Airbnb Data in the Seattle Folder for calendar, reviews and listings</li>
<li>The Jupyter notebook that I used to run this data</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>It's important to note that there are a few libraries that are required to run this Jupyter notebook.
Included is the nltk, pandas, and the vaderSentiment package!</p>
<p>This is definitely a work in progress, but it's operational right now!</p>
<p>The fanciest thing I did was create a machine learning algorithm to predict AirBnb prices based off the reviews!</p>
<h4>TL:DR; This is a working document to analyze Seattle Airbnb Data!</h4>
